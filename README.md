# jsweb
A JavaScript project


Get started It's as easy as 1, 2, 3!
Before you start, you need to globally install create-js-project via npm or yarn:
```shell
npm i -g create-js-project
yarn global add create-js-project
```
Then, follow these 3 simple steps:

Create a project, optionally providing a [project-name] for your project:

```shell
create-js-project [project-name]
```


```shell
npm init js-project [project-name]
```

Answer the questions, such as your project's name and desired template.

Wait until the installation is complete and start coding!
